Storch Tensors
--------------

To keep track of the stochastic computation graph, Storchastic returns wrapped :class:`torch.Tensor` that are subclasses of
:class:`storch.Tensor`. This wrapper contains information that allows Storchastic to analyse the computation graph
during inference to properly estimate gradients. Furthermore, :class:`storch.Tensor` contains plate information that allows
for automatic broadcasting with other :class:`storch.Tensor` objects with different plate information.
